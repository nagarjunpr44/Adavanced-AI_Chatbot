# Adavanced-AI_Chatbot


```markdown

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to create an AI chatbot using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stack with Astra DB and OpenAI's language model. The chatbot can retrieve context from a vector database and generate responses based on the provided context.

## Overview

This notebook covers the following steps:
1. Setting up the environment with necessary libraries.
2. Configuring the embedding model and vector store.
3. Loading and preparing a dataset of philosopher quotes.
4. Inserting documents into the vector store.
5. Performing basic retrieval and generating responses using a prompt.
6. Cleaning up the collection in the vector store.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Astra DB account and API credentials
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_chatbot_ragstack.git
cd ai_chatbot_ragstack
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include:
```
ragstack-ai
datasets
langchain-openai
cassio
```

Alternatively, you can install the packages directly in the notebook:

```python
!pip install -q ragstack-ai datasets
!pip install -U langchain-openai
```

## Usage

1. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set your Astra DB API endpoint, application token, and OpenAI API key.
2. **Create RAG Pipeline**: Configure the embedding model and vector store.
3. **Load Dataset**: Load a sample dataset of philosopher quotes.
4. **Prepare Documents**: Create a set of documents from the dataset.
5. **Insert Documents**: Add the documents to the vector store.
6. **Retrieve and Generate Response**: Use the model to generate responses based on retrieved context.
7. **Cleanup**: Delete the collection and all documents in the collection.

For detailed instructions, refer to the notebook.
